Service Concept

Continuing training alone is challenging, and many people quit, so Trainees aims to create a web app that habituates exercise, introduces users to workout companions, and provides mutual support. 

The idea originated from the founder's experience as a beginner, feeling the need for workout companions but struggling to find motivation. Thus, the service facilitates online communication, increases workout companionship, and enhances continuity.

 Trainees values not only training management but also the connections formed with workout companions. 
 
 The goal is to improve users' workout experiences, provide tools for achieving individual goals, create an enjoyable and sustainable community, and realize personal goal achievements.
